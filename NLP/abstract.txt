**Abstract**

In the domain of risk management, articulating detailed control descriptions tailored to specific business processes and their associated risks is crucial. This study introduces a novel application of the FLAN-T5 model, a variant of the Transformer-based T5 model, which has been adapted to generate structured textual outputs that are segmented into distinct components: why, where, when, how, what, and who. Recognizing the complexity and verbosity of control descriptions, we employ a chunking strategy to divide the generation task into two phases: the first phase generates "why, where, when," and the second "how, what, who."

We developed a specialized training regime and evaluation methodology to fine-tune and validate the FLAN-T5 model on a curated dataset. The dataset comprises business process descriptions paired with associated risks and corresponding multi-faceted control measures. Each control measure is elaborately described with the six aforementioned components to ensure comprehensive coverage.

To address potential model performance issues related to the token limitations inherent in Transformer models, we trained two separate models for each chunk of the control descriptions. This approach allowed for more focused learning and reduced the risk of truncating important information. Our evaluation framework incorporated precision, recall, F1-score, and BLEU metrics to provide a multi-dimensional assessment of model performance, emphasizing the accuracy and coherence of the generated text.

The results suggest that the chunking approach, combined with the robust capabilities of the FLAN-T5 model, effectively enhances the generation of detailed, relevant, and contextually appropriate control descriptions. This method holds significant potential for automating aspects of risk management documentation and improving the efficiency and reliability of enterprise risk assessments.

Abstract Summary

This study explores the adaptation of the FLAN-T5 model, a Transformer-based approach, to automate the generation of structured control descriptions in risk management. We implement a chunking strategy to address the challenges of verbose and complex descriptions, dividing the task into two phases for improved detail and manageability. Each phase focuses on different segments ("why, where, when" and "how, what, who") of control descriptions, fine-tuned and evaluated on a specially curated dataset using precision, recall, F1-score, and BLEU metrics. Results highlight the effectiveness of the dual-phase approach in producing coherent and detailed control measures, indicating significant potential for enhancing the efficiency of risk management processes.

**Abstract Summary**

This research leverages the FLAN-T5 model to automate the generation of detailed control descriptions for risk management, using a two-phase chunking approach to handle complex data efficiently. The model is trained on distinct segments— "why, where, when" followed by "how, what, who"—to ensure thorough coverage and detail. Precision, recall, F1-score, and BLEU metrics assess the model's output, affirming its capability to produce accurate and relevant control descriptions. The approach demonstrates substantial promise for improving documentation accuracy and process efficiency in risk management practices.
