For speech-to-text (STT) tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically designed or fine-tuned for understanding and transcribing spoken language are preferred. While models like GPT (including GPT-3 and GPT-4) are not directly used for speech-to-text, they are often used downstream to process the text once it's been converted from speech. Here are some models and technologies you might consider for speech-to-text:

1. **Google Speech-to-Text**: This is a cloud-based tool by Google that converts audio to text using advanced deep learning techniques. It supports multiple languages and can handle noisy audio.

2. **IBM Watson Speech to Text**: Another cloud-based service that uses deep learning algorithms to transcribe spoken words into written text. It offers real-time speech recognition and can be customized for your vocabulary.

3. **Microsoft Azure Speech to Text**: Part of Microsoft Azure's cognitive services, this tool provides real-time speech transcription, integrating with Microsoft's LLMs for further processing and understanding of the text.

4. **Mozilla DeepSpeech**: An open-source speech-to-text engine based on deep learning techniques. It's a part of Mozilla's initiative to make speech recognition technology more accessible.

5. **Wav2Vec 2.0/3.0**: Developed by Facebook AI (now Meta AI), Wav2Vec is designed for speech recognition tasks and works by learning speech representations directly from waveforms. Wav2Vec 2.0 and the newer versions have shown significant improvements in transcribing speech with minimal supervised training data.

6. **Whisper**: OpenAI's Whisper model is a large neural network trained on a diverse range of internet-collected data and designed for robust speech recognition. It performs well across a variety of languages and domains, making it a powerful option for speech-to-text tasks.

Each of these models has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice depends on your specific requirements, such as the languages you need to support, the domain-specific vocabulary, the audio quality, and whether you prefer cloud-based services or open-source solutions you can run on your own infrastructure.
