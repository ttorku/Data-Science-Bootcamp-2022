Your task is to generate obligations based on the description of a business process. This is a text generation task, which can be approached as a Language Modeling (LM) problem. In this context, you want to use a Language Model to generate text that describes the obligations associated with a given business process.

For this task, we can use a pre-trained Language Model from the Hugging Face Transformers library and fine-tune it on your data. GPT-2 or GPT-3 could be good choices for this task as they are designed for text generation. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, GPT-3 is not openly available in Hugging Face's model hub due to licensing issues. We'll use GPT-2 in this example.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps you would need to take:

1. **Preprocessing**: Prepare your data in a format suitable for training a Language Model. Typically, this involves concatenating your texts and splitting them into chunks of a certain length.

2. **Tokenization**: Use a GPT-2 tokenizer to convert your texts into a format that the model can understand.

3. **Model Training**: Fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on your data. This involves feeding your tokenized texts into the model and optimizing the model's parameters to minimize a loss function.

4. **Text Generation**: Use the trained model to generate obligations for a given business process. This involves feeding the business process into the model and having the model generate the subsequent tokens.

Unfortunately, my current environment doesn't support PyTorch model training, so I can't execute these steps directly. However, I can provide you with a pseudo-code example of how you might implement these steps using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

This pseudo-code assumes that you have a dataset where each row corresponds to a business process followed by its associated obligation. The model is trained to predict each token in the obligation given the business process and the preceding tokens.

```python
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel, TextDataset, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load the data
data_path = "path_to_your_data"  # Replace with the actual path to your data
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Preprocess the data
data['text'] = data['Business Process'] + " " + data['Obligation']
texts = data['text'].tolist()

# Initialize the GPT-2 tokenizer and model
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Tokenize the data
inputs = tokenizer(texts, return_tensors='pt', truncation=True, padding=True)

# Create a PyTorch Dataset from the tokenized data
dataset = TextDataset(tensor_data=inputs['input_ids'])

# Initialize a data collator for language modeling
data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False)

# Define the training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=64,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
)

# Initialize a Trainer with the training arguments and the data collator
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    train_dataset=dataset,
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()

# Save the trained model
model.save_pretrained('./trained_model')
```

After training the model, you can use it to generate obligations for a given business process as follows:

```python
# Load the trained model and tokenizer
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('./trained_model')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Use the model to generate an obligation for a given business process
business_process = "Your business process here"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(business_process, return_tensors='pt')
generated_tokens = model.generate(input_ids, do_sample=True, max_length=50, temperature=0.7)
obligation = tokenizer.decode(generated_tokens[0])

print(f"Generated Obligation: {obligation}")
```

This code generates a sequence of up to 50 tokens following the given business process. The `do_sample=True` option tells the model to sample from the distribution of next tokens rather than always choosing the most likely next token, which makes the generated text more diverse. The `temperature` parameter controls the randomness of the sampling process: a higher value (close to 1) makes the sampling more random, while a lower value (close to 0) makes it more deterministic.


After fine-tuning the GPT-2 model on your dataset, you can validate its performance by using it to generate obligations for some business processes in a validation set and comparing the generated obligations to the actual obligations.

Here's a high-level overview of how you might validate the model:

1. **Generate obligations for the validation set**: Apply the model to each business process in the validation set and record the generated obligations.

2. **Compare to the actual obligations**: Compare the generated obligations to the actual obligations. This could involve qualitative analysis (looking at the generated and actual obligations and assessing how well they match), quantitative analysis (using a text similarity metric to measure how similar the generated and actual obligations are), or both.

Here's an example of how you might implement these steps in code:

```python
# Load the validation data
val_data_path = "path_to_your_validation_data"  # Replace with the actual path to your validation data
val_data = pd.read_csv(val_data_path)

# Initialize lists to store the generated and actual obligations
generated_obligations = []
actual_obligations = []

# Apply the model to each business process in the validation data
for _, row in val_data.iterrows():
    business_process = row['Business Process']
    actual_obligation = row['Obligation']
    
    # Generate an obligation
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode(business_process, return_tensors='pt')
    generated_tokens = model.generate(input_ids, do_sample=True, max_length=50, temperature=0.7)
    generated_obligation = tokenizer.decode(generated_tokens[0])
    
    # Add the generated and actual obligations to the lists
    generated_obligations.append(generated_obligation)
    actual_obligations.append(actual_obligation)

# Compute a text similarity metric between the generated and actual obligations
# This could be the Jaccard similarity, cosine similarity, BLEU score, etc.
# The choice of metric depends on what you consider to be a "good" match between the generated and actual obligations
similarity_scores = compute_similarity(generated_obligations, actual_obligations)

# Print the average similarity score
print(f"Average similarity score: {np.mean(similarity_scores)}")
```

In this code, `compute_similarity` is a placeholder for a function that computes a text similarity metric of your choice between the generated and actual obligations. This could be a simple metric like the Jaccard similarity or a more complex metric like the BLEU score or cosine similarity in a word embedding space. The choice of metric depends on what you consider to be a "good" match between the generated and actual obligations.

Keep in mind that this is just one way to validate the model, and it might not be the best approach for your specific use case. For example, if the exact wording of the obligations isn't important and there are multiple valid ways to express the same obligation, then a text similarity metric might not be a good measure of model performance. In this case, you might need to come up with a more sophisticated validation strategy.


Sure, let's define a function `compute_similarity` that computes the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF representations of two texts. The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) representation is a common way of representing text data in NLP.

Here's an example of how you might implement this function:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def compute_similarity(texts1, texts2):
    # Combine the two lists of texts
    texts = texts1 + texts2

    # Compute the TF-IDF representation of each text
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer().fit(texts)
    tfidf = vectorizer.transform(texts)

    # Split the TF-IDF representation into two sets corresponding to the two lists of texts
    tfidf1 = tfidf[:len(texts1)]
    tfidf2 = tfidf[len(texts1):]

    # Compute the cosine similarity between each pair of texts
    similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(tfidf1, tfidf2).diagonal()

    return similarity_scores
```

In this code, the `TfidfVectorizer` class from the `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` module is used to compute the TF-IDF representation of each text. The `cosine_similarity` function from the `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` module is used to compute the cosine similarity between each pair of texts. The `diagonal` method is used to get the similarity scores for the pairs of texts with the same index in the two lists.

This function can be used in the validation code I provided earlier like this:

```python
# Compute a text similarity metric between the generated and actual obligations
similarity_scores = compute_similarity(generated_obligations, actual_obligations)

# Print the average similarity score
print(f"Average similarity score: {np.mean(similarity_scores)}")
```

Please note that this is just one way of computing a text similarity metric, and it might not be the best choice for your specific use case. Depending on the characteristics of your texts and what you consider to be a "good" match, other metrics might be more appropriate.
